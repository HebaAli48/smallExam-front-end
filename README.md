# Front-end short test

The front-end Resposive test consists of a welcome page that take first name of user and stored it in cookies, then redirects the user to an exam page with 10 questions. Once the user selects an answer for a question, all other choices are disabled, and the result of the answer is displayed as either correct or wrong. A progress bar is displayed to show the user's progress in answering the questions relative to the total number of questions.

After the user finishes the exam, a rank is sent from an API and displayed on a result page along with a status message based on the rank. A "Try Again" button is provided to allow the user to retake the exam.
